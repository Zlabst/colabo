          <h2 class="colorBlack">The company</h2>
          <p>EarlySense is a patient monitoring platform that continuously alerts and notifies healthcare professionals about
            their patients’ statuses, enabling clinicians to quickly detect patient deterioration and intervene early. EarlySense
            currently services some of the leading hospitals worldwide, including Newton Wellesley Hospital, Brigham and
            Women’s Hospital, and Nashoba Valley Medical Center.</p>
          <h2 class="colorBlack">The challange</h2>
          <p>The sales representatives at EarlySense were frustrated that they were spending valuable time tediously researching
            leads instead of pursuing and engaging them. They wasted hours searching through FDA sites for hospitals with high
            patient satisfaction and then cross referencing the hospitals with the appropriate personnel listed on LinkedIn.
            Still, they weren’t done researching; they scoured the web for additional contact information, copied and pasted
            this information to spreadsheets, and finally uploaded everything to their CRM. Clearly, this was an inefficient and
            antiquated process that was costing the company money and lost opportunities. More wasteful and irritating was
            having to continuously repeat the process to manually update their CRM.</p>
          <h2 class="colorBlack">The solution</h2>
          <p>In search for a tool that would automate their manual work, EarlySense was excited to discover Colabo.
            The SDRs at EarlySense, who generate the bulk of their leads from LinkedIn, use the Colabo Clipper to clip dozens
            of leads at a time from LinkedIn and other social media favorites directly to their CRM—Salesforce, in their case.
            Because the Clipper is a downloadable Chrome extension that integrates into the social networking services
            EarlySense already uses, the SDRs at EarlySense quickly learned just how easy it is to use Colabo.
            In just one click, the SDRs push valuable information from LinkedIn to Salesforce that Colabo then automatically
            enriches with additional contact information, company information, and social profiles. Colabo also continuously
            analyzes and checks that this information within their CRM is up to date, allowing the SDRs to focus their time and
            energy productively pursuing leads based on valuable and fresh information.</p>
          <h2 class="colorBlack">The results</h2>
          <p>In automating their prospecting process with Colabo, EarlySense greatly increased the number and quality of leads
            being pursued, leading to increased sales in a shorter time frame. EarlySense reduced time spent prospecting by 70%
            by using Colabo’s Clipper and CRM Integration tools. And because the SDRs at EarlySense suddenly had more hours
            to pursue and engage leads, they were able to accomplish a 450% increase in new meetings.</p>

          <h2 class="colorBlack">The company</h2>
          <p>Stratogent is a leading IT managed services provider in the San Francisco Bay Area, offering 24/7
            infrastructure support.</p>
          <h2 class="colorBlack">The challange</h2>
          <p>The sales representatives at Stratogent were spending hours trying to reach prospects by email and phone,
            with little success. They were often ignored—as emails were most probably lost in overflowing inboxes and calls
            from unfamiliar numbers were being screened. In the face of a rapidly changing and competitive sales environment,
            Stratogent urgently needed a solution to increase their response rate.</p>
          <h2 class="colorBlack">The solution</h2>
          <p>Stratogent’s Sales Director came across Colabo and learned how Colabo can help increase and automate engagement
            efforts. The SDRs at Stratogent no longer rely just on email and phone to initiate contact with leads, but also prospect
            through LinkedIn InMail, Meetup Messaging, and other direct messaging services offered by social networking sites.
            In Colabo, the SDRs are able to craft template-based messages, personalize them by using dynamic replacements,
            and send them off in bulk. In harnessing the intimacy of social media messages, Colabo enables Stratogent to craft
            highly relevant and targeted messages that have greater chances of appealing to their prospects.
            Stratogent recognized that this, in combination with Colabo’s ability to send tens, if not hundreds, of intimate messages
            at once, is a breakthrough in their engagement efforts. Within days, the SDRs were receiving dozens of responses,
            a rate unfathomable had they stuck to email and phone. In addition, Colabo notifies the SDRs about incoming
            responses and automatically syncs with Stratogent’s CRM—Oracle Sales Cloud—to update the activity logs accordingly,
            increasing efficiency in every spectrum.</p>
          <h2 class="colorBlack">The results</h2>
          <p>Contacting leads with Colabo on optimized channels greatly increased Stratogent’s response rate, and thus its closing
            ratio, sales and revenue. In using Colabo’s Engagement feature, Stratogent increased their response rate by 10x!
            Because more people were responding, in just 60 days, the SDRs experienced a 350% increase in the amount of first
            meetings they were able to set up.</p>
