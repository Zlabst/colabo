						This is the privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") that governs how we, Colabo Inc. ("Colabo", "we", "our" or "us"), use Personal Information (defined below) that we collect, receive and store about individuals in connection with the use of: (i) the website <a href="http://www.colabo.com/">www.colabo.com</a>, and any other website that we operate (each, together with its sub-domains, content and services, a "Site"); and (ii) any software that we license or enable access to ("Software"). The Site and the Software are individually and collectively referred to herein as the "Service".
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Introduction.</strong> We have implemented this Privacy Policy because your privacy, and the privacy of other Service users, is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your Personal Information is collected and used in connection with the Service. You are aware that you are not legally obligated to provide us Personal Information, and you hereby confirm that providing us personal information is at your own free will. "<strong>Personal Information&#8203;</strong>" means any information that may be used, either alone or in combination with other information, to personally identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, a personal profile, an email address, a home or other physical address, or other contact information.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Terms of Service.</strong> This Privacy Policy forms part of the Terms of Service, available at <a href="http://www.colabo.com/ToS.php">www.colabo.com/ToS</a> ("<strong>Terms of Service</strong>") and, if applicable, the End User License Agreement ("<strong>EULA</strong>"), the terms of which you read and agreed to prior to downloading, installing, accessing and/or using the Software. Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the foregoing documents.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Consent and Modification.&#8203;</strong> By using the Service, you consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy and to Colabo's processing of Personal Information for the purposes set forth herein. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not access or otherwise use the Service. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change this Privacy Policy at any time. Such change will be effective ten (10) days following posting of the revised Privacy Policy on the Site, and your continued use of the Service thereafter means that you accept those changes.
					</li>
					
					<li>
						<strong>What Personal Information We Collect and How We Collect It.&#8203;</strong> We receive and/or collect Personal Information from you in the following ways:
						<ol>
							<li><u>Account.</u> In order to access and use certain parts of the Service, you may be required to first create an account ("<strong>Account&#8203;</strong>"), and provide us with certain information which may include your user name, email address, and a password that you will use for your Account.</li>
							<li><u>'Contact Us' Information.</u> If you send us a "Contact Us" request, whether by submitting an online form that we make available on the Service or by sending an email to an email address that we display on the Service, you may be required to provide us with information such as your name, username and email address.</li>
							<li><u>Software Downloads and Access.</u> We may offer you the opportunity to download or access certain Software from the Site. If you choose to do so, you may first be required to provide certain Personal Information such as your name, email address and other specified information.</li>
							<li><u>Public Profile.</u> Some parts of the Site may enable you to build a public profile in connection with your Account ("<strong>Public Profile&#8203;</strong>"). Your Public Profile will include your user name. You may also choose to include other information, such as a profile picture.</li>
							<li><u>Purchases.</u> The Service includes the option to purchase certain products or services from us. If you choose to make a purchase we, or a third party payment processor, will require sufficient information from you to complete the transaction. Such information could include a credit card number and related account and billing information, invoice related information, and other data required to process the order. We may also update such data should you grant us permission to bill you or your credit card for recurring charges, such as monthly or other types of periodic payments. We may use the tools, software or services of third-party service providers to process transactions on our behalf, in which case you acknowledge and agree to review and be bound by the terms of use and privacy policy of said third-party service provider</li>
							<li><u>Community.</u> Some parts of the Service enable you to participate in an open forum that enables you to share your knowledge and experiences with Colabo and our users and also to receive and view related information from us and other users ("<strong>Community&#8203;</strong>"). If you choose to participate in the Community, you may be required to provide certain information such as your user name.</li>
							<li><u>Log Files.</u> The Service may make use of log files. The information inside the log files includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, type of browser, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date/time stamp, referring/exit pages, clicked pages and any other information your browser may send to us. We may use such information to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement around the Service, and gather demographic information.</li>
							<li><u>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies.</u> Some of our Service pages may utilize "cookies" and other tracking technologies. A "cookie" is a small text file that may be used, for example, to collect information about Service activity. Certain cookies and other technologies may serve to recall Personal Information, such as an IP address, previously indicated by a Service user. We use first party cookies to remember which of our servers you have logged in to, session cookies during each session on our Site, and Google Analytics and Piwik tracking cookies to measure your activity on our Service (and these services may contain your email), and the data from these tracking cookies is stored. Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					
					<li><strong>Publicly Available Information.</strong>
						<ol>
							<li><u>Public Profile.</u>  Your Public Profile will be publicly available to other Site users, and may also be accessed and used by people off the Site. The notices and tools that we provide on the Site should help inform you which information will be made publicly available. With the exception of your username, you retain the right to decide what information to include in your Public Profile.</li>
							<li><u>Community.</u> If you post and publish content to a public part of the Site ("<strong>User Submissions&#8203;</strong>"), such as the Community zone, then your User Submissions will be publicly available to other Site users and may also be accessed and used by people off the Site.</li>
							<li><u>Contact Information.</u> If you publish your contact information in a User Submission or as part of your Public Profile, you may receive unsolicited messages from Site users or the public. We therefore encourage you to only post information that you are sure you want to be accessible to anyone.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					
					<li>
						<strong>The Way We Use Personal Information.</strong> &#8203;If you submit or we collect Personal Information through the Service, then such Personal Information may be used in the following ways, via any applicable communication channel, including e-mail, SMS, etc.:
						<ol>
							<li>We will use your Personal Information to provide and improve our Service, to send you marketing/advertisement communications that we believe may be of interest to you, to send lead alerts, to contact you in connection with the Service and certain programs or offerings that you may have registered for, and to identify and authenticate your access to the parts of the Service that you are authorized to access.</li>
							<li>We may use your designated email address to: (i) send you updates or news regarding the Service, our products and services; and/or (ii) respond to a "Contact Us" or administrative request (for example, to change your password).</li>
							<li>If you include Personal Information in your Public Profile or User Submissions that you post to a public area of the Site, then such Personal Information will be generally publicly available.</li>

Such information may be transferred to other countries around the world. We require that these parties agree to process such information in compliance with our Privacy Policy.</li>
							<li>We may transfer your Personal Information to our third party service providers (such as a server hosting provider, or other cloud providers), but only to provide our services to us or you. Such information may be transferred to other countries around the world, and you agree that you have obtained all necessary consents for such transfers in connection with any Personal Information that you submit to the Service. We use commercially reasonable efforts to only engage or interact with third party service providers that post a Privacy Policy governing their processing of Personal Information.</li>
							<li>We may disclose your Personal Information or any information you submitted via the Service if we have a good faith belief that disclosure of such information is helpful or reasonably necessary to: (i) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request; (ii) enforce our Terms of Service and/or EULA, including investigations of potential violations thereof; (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud or security issues; and/or (iv) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Colabo, its users, yourself or the public.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					
					<li>
						<strong>Use of Anonymous Information.</strong>&#8203; We may use Anonymous Information (as defined below) or disclose it to third party service providers in order to improve our services and enhance your experience with the Service. We may also disclose Anonymous Information (with or without compensation) to third parties, including advertisers and partners. "<strong>Anonymous Information&#8203;</strong>" means information which does not enable identification of an individual user, such as aggregated information about the use of our Service.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Opting Out.</strong> &#8203;You may choose not to receive future promotional, advertising, or other Service-related emails from us by selecting an unsubscribe link at the bottom of each email that you receive from us. Please note that even if you opt out of receiving the foregoing emails, we may still send you a response to any "Contact Us" request as well as administrative emails (for example, in connection with a password reset request) that are necessary to facilitate your use of the Service.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Choice.</strong> &#8203;At all times, you may choose whether or not to provide or disclose Personal Information. The notices that we provide on the Service in circumstances where we collect Personal Information should help you to make this choice. If you choose not to provide the Personal Information we request, you may still visit parts of the Service, but you may be unable to access certain options, programs, offers, and services that involve our interaction with you.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Access/Accuracy.</strong> &#8203;To the extent that you do provide us with Personal Information, Colabo wishes to maintain accurate Personal Information. You may use the Service tools to remove or modify certain information such as your password or designated email address. If you would like to delete or correct any other of your Personal Information that we may be storing, you may submit a request to us by sending an email to <a href="mailto:support@colabo.com">support@colabo.com</a>.  Your email should include adequate details of your request. 
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Removal of User Submissions.</strong> &#8203;If you wish to have one or more of your User Submissions containing Personal Information removed from a public area of the Site, then you may send us a request to <a href="mailto:support@colabo.com">support@colabo.com</a>.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Collection of Information by Third Party Sites.</strong> &#8203;We may use a reputable third party to present or serve advertisements that you may see on the Site. These third party ad servers may use cookies, web beacons, clear gifs or similar technologies to help present such advertisements, and to help measure and research the advertisements' effectiveness. The use of these technologies by these third party ad servers is subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by our Privacy Policy.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Links to Other Sites.</strong> &#8203;The Service may contain links to third party websites that are not owned or controlled by Colabo. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of third party websites.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Children's Privacy.</strong> &#8203;The Service is not structured to attract children under the age of 13 years. Accordingly, we do not intend to collect Personal Information from anyone we know to be under 13 years. If we learn that we have collected Personal Information from a child under 13 years, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any such information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@colabo.com">support@colabo.com</a>.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Security.</strong> &#8203;The security of Personal Information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards, including the use of appropriate administrative, physical and technical safeguards, to protect the Personal Information submitted to us. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security or confidentiality. If you have any questions about security on the Service, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:support@colabo.com">support@colabo.com</a>. 
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Merger, Sale or Bankruptcy.</strong> &#8203;In the event that we are acquired by or merged with a third party entity, or in the event of bankruptcy or a comparable event, we reserve the right to transfer or assign Personal Information in connection with the foregoing events.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>California Privacy Rights.</strong> &#8203;California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits customers of Colabo who are California residents to request certain information regarding its disclosure of Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an email to <a href="mailto:support@colabo.com">support@colabo.com</a>.  Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Our California Do Not Track Notice&#8203;.</strong> We track users over time on our Service using your email address, but do not track across third party websites. For one tracking mechanism, we respond to Do Not Track signals and for another tracking mechanism, we do not. We do not allow third parties to collect personally identifiable information about an individual consumer’s online activities over time and across different web sites when a consumer uses the Site, except that the Service does use Google Analytics as a way to measure user activity on our Site.
					</li>
					<li>
					<strong>Deletion of Content from California Residents.</strong> If you are a California resident under the age of 18, and a registered user, California Business and Professions Code Section 22581 permits you to request and obtain removal of content or information you have publicly posted. To make such a request, please send an email with a detailed description of the specific content or information to <a href="mailto:califprivacy@colabo.com">califprivacy@colabo.com</a>. Please be aware that such a request does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information you have posted and that there may be circumstances in which the law does not require or allow removal even if requested.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Commitment.  We are committed to protecting your privacy.</strong> &#8203;Protecting your privacy online is an evolving area, and we are constantly evolving our Service to meet these demands. If you have any comments or questions regarding our Privacy Policy, or your Personal Information that we may be storing and using, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@colabo.com">support@colabo.com.</a> </li>
